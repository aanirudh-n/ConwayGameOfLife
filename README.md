Conway's Game of Life (CUDA Implementation)

A parallelized implementation of Conway's Game of Life using CUDA.

🖥️ Overview
This project implements Conway's Game of Life using CUDA to leverage parallel computing on GPUs. It demonstrates how cellular automata can be efficiently simulated using CUDA's parallel processing capabilities.

🚀 Features
Parallel execution of Game of Life rules using CUDA kernels.
Supports a 2D grid with periodic boundary conditions.
Uses randomly initialized cells as the starting state.
Displays iteration-based evolution of cells.
Optimized memory management using CUDA.

📝 Rules of Conway's Game of Life
Each cell in the grid follows these simple rules:

🟩 Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive.
☠️ Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
🚀 Overpopulation: A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
🌱 Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
